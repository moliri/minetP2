Bugs:

Notes: For input, [S] = server, [C] = client

1 [x] ACCEPT issue
		INPUT												OUTPUT
		- [S] ./start_minet.sh "tcp_server u 2323"			- tcp_server module prints:
																Stack initialized
																Socket created.
																Socket bound.
																Socket listened.
																Accept failed.
																reason:: unknown error
															- sock_module prints:
																Module is dying due to SIGSEGV
																Enter to continue (closes module)
		
		- [C] nc 10.10.14.23 2323							- tcp_module prints:
																Module is dying due to SIGSEGV
																Enter to continue (closes module)
		
		Info from groups:
		- Getting segmentation faults when we see SIGSEGV, likely need to modify ACCEPT.
		- maybe need to modify initialization of mux and sock?
		- event.handle == sock, so we enter second if statement
		- when updated IP Header is printed, it looks like it copies to the packet incorrectly
			- header length is set incorrectly
		- destination IP address is not set properly
		
		RESOLVED:
		- Added call to MinetReceive which was missing, socket module no longer crashes; connection is received

2 [ ] IP Header issue
		- [S] ./start_minet.sh "tcp_server u 2323"			- tcp_server module prints:
																Stack initialized
																Socket created.
																Socket bound.
																Socket listened.
		
		- [C] nc 10.10.14.23 2323
